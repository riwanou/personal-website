# Learning Particle System

## Introduction

Welcome to my first post where I will try to show you how I got a simple particle system up and running with **threejs**.
Before starting, we first need to understand what we want and need.
In my case, my objective is to be able to render basic effects like basic exmplosion or fire, that's why I will here only focus on simple implementation.
